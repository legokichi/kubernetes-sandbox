==== Deploy multiple releases with Helm

You can deploy multiple releases with skaffold, each will need a chartPath, a values file, and namespace.
Skaffold can inject intermediate build tags in the the values map in the skaffold.yaml.

Let's walk through the skaffold yaml

We'll be building an image called `skaffold-helm`, and its a dockerfile, so we'll add it to the artifacts.
```
build:
  artifacts:
  - imageName: skaffold-helm
```

Now, we want to deploy this image with helm.
We add a new release in the helm part of the deploy stanza.
```
deploy:
  helm:
    releases:
    - name: skaffold-helm
      chartPath: skaffold-helm
      namespace: skaffold
      values:
        image: skaffold-helm
```

This part tells skaffold to set the `image` parameter of the values file to the built skaffold-helm image and tag.
```
      values:
        image: skaffold-helm
```
